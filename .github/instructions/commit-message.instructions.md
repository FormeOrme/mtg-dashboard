When writing a commit message,
check the code diff to understand what changed,
then follow these guidelines:

-   Separate subject from body with a blank line.
-   Limit the subject line to 50 characters. This keeps it readable.
-   Capitalize the subject line.
-   Do not end the subject line with a period.
-   Use the imperative mood in the subject line. (e.g., Add feature not Added feature)
-   Wrap the body at 72 characters. This ensures the message is easy to read in various tools.
-   The code itself shows how, so the commit message should explain the reasoning behind the change.

The commit message should follow the conventional commit format.
